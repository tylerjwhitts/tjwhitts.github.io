title: We're up and running!
---

After a couple hours working out how MathJax worked with Jekyll we are up and running. However, it looks like it will take more work than first anticipated to get the site constructed in the way I want. Ideally, I will have all my notes categorised in folders that you can access from a drop down menu. This would give me all my important notes on physics, python, bash, quantum computing, cryptography (if I ever get around to it) etc in one location. 

This is definitely more of a long term project. Chances are I will give up on it like most things I start these days. But for now here's to the start of something new! And here's to my first blog post!  

Maybe I'll even start blogging too. If I can find something that I am mildly interested in writing about. Scratch that I will have to extremely interested in a topic to write about it.

Until next time.
