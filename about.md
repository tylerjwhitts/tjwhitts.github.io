I am a physic graduate wanting to move into the technology industry. My physics interests include many-body systems (semiconductors and superconductors), quantum mechanics, quantum computing and statistics.

My tech insterests include web development, software development, HPC, data science and AI/ML.
I also have a passion for optimising workflows whether that be for personal use or to stream line group projects.

I am most proficient in Python but I have experience in MATLAB, C++, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## Education
