I am a recent Physics Masters of Philosophy graduate from the University of Adelaide. I am interested in many-body systems such as semiconductors and superconductors and the quantum phenomena they exhibit when confined to nanoscales. My recent work includes numerically modelling the effective g-factor and spin-orbit interactions in InAs nanowires. I also have a passion for optimising workflows whether that be for personal use or to stream line group projects.
