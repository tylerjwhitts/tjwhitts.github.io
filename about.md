I am a physic graduate wanting to move into the technology industry. My physics interests include many-body systems (e.g. semiconductors and superconductors), quantum mechanics, quantum computing, statistics and thermodynamics.
I am also interested in web development, software development, HPC, data science and AI/ML.
I also have a passion for optimising workflows whether that be for personal use or to stream line group projects.

I am most proficient in Python but I have experience in MATLAB, C++, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## Masters of Philosophy - Physics
*University of Adelaide | 2023*
**Title:** Quantum transport and spin-orbit coupling in semiconducting nanostructures.
Numerical modelling of the effective g-factor and spin-orbit interactions in InAs nanowires. 
Low temperature measurements of nanoscale semiconducting devices.
