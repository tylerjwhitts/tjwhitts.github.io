I am a current Physics Masters of Philosophy student at the University of Adelaide. I am an experimental condense matter physicist numerically modelling the g-factor and spin-orbit properties of InAs nanowires. My interests include  semiconducting qubits, spin qubits, topological qubits, InAs, Si, quantum computing, spin-orbit coupling, tight-binding and cryogenic measuremetns.
